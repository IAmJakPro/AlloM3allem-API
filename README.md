Welcome to AlloMaallem! Amine - Mourad - Ismail - Hamza
## General Notes
- Each schema contains 'toClient' method, which has two params (isAdmin, lang), This method helps us to format the json response data to send it to the client with the format and structure we want.
- More notes in the sooner future.......

Thanks everyone:)
